# Full Stack open 2021

The course is the same as in the Full stack course held at the Department of Computer Science at the University of Helsinki.

I took this course during my fourth semester at Cracow University of Technology. I was not a newbie React or Node developer but I took it because it was a great revision and test of my skills. Additionaly, I learned a lot about testing frontend and backend applications with Cypress, Jest, SuperTest and React Testing Library. I also learned about an alternative to REST API which is GraphQL and fell in love with TypeScript❤️
